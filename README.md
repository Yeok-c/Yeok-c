# Hi there, I'm YeokTatt Cheah 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about developing data-driven software. This usually entails statistics, large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), agentic frameworks, data loading and retrieval pipelines.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I’ve temporarily left the workspace to complete my Master of Science in Machine Learning UCL - an excellent program with modules from Deepmind and Gatsby.
- ⚡ I used to work in computer vision and data-driven robotics but I'm trying to take a (potentially permanent) detour into natural language processing as I believe it is core to all intelligent software in the future.   
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to my projects, I’m happy to help explain small concepts or point you in the right directions.
